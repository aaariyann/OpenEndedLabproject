My first ever CS project. It's a simple programme which can only run on a compiler. (I have added the .cbp file for you if you are interested to run it.)

The programme I made “POTATO PC BUILDER” is summarised below :
~ Greets a user and asks if he wants to sign up and build his pc.
~ If yes, it takes information about the user and asks if they have a membership ID. If the ID matches the user gets a discount.
~ Then it lets the user to choose components from each brands and shows the list of available models with price from a file.
~ The user decides which components they want to purchase and the programme automatically calculates the required power 
consumption and assigns a compatible power supply adding its price.
~ Then the programme shows the users choice of components and and total price. Also the discounted price if they get it.

The programme will offer the customer 3 key features :
~ They will get a variety of options to choose from.
~ The programme will calculate the power consumption automatically and offer the required power supply unit with price. 
~ They will get a special discount if they have a MEMBERSHIP ID

In conclusion, it covers most of the basic concepts on C++. You can modify it and use if you are a newbie like me and it falls under you interest.
